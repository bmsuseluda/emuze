## 0.55.0

Finally this release is done. It went quite longer then i expected. I had to do a lot under the hood with some major version jumps of the libraries i use that lead to bigger refactorings.

With the downfall of citra the future of 3DS emulation was uncertain at best, but not long after 2 citra forks raised from the ashes: Lime3DS with a focus of UI- and quality of life changes and PabloMK7s Citra with a focus of accurate emulation. Both projects merged now into Azahar so it was time to replace Lime3DS with Azahar, bundle and pre configure it in emuze.

Next to Azahar i bundled and preconfigured PCSX2.
24 of the 33 supported systems are pre configured and 20 of them are bundled nowü•≥

Besides this and a lot of bug fixes i did some quality of life changes. You can now close a game with the controller and emuze all together. Also there is an "About" Page in the settings Overlay where you can find links to the github, discord and changelog.

Please let me know what you think of it in the [emuze discord](https://discord.gg/tCzK7kc6Y4).

### üí• Features
- set Azahar as the default emulator for 3DS. You can switch back to Lime3DS with the command line option `--lime3ds` if you are facing some issues
- pre configure Azahar

- close game via
  - Xbox: `back + a`
  - PlayStation: `select + x`
  - Nintendo: `select + b`
- map keyboard if no controller is connected on DuckStation
- map keyboard if no controller is connected on PCSX2
- map keyboard if no controller is connected on Dolphin
- align with XDG specification. Old settings will be migrated automatically
- add confirmation dialog to close emuze with a gamepad

## 0.54.0

As long as I have been working on emuze, there was one topic that I was never really satisfied with: The first import when setting up emuze took far too long. The reason is quite simple: To retrieve meta data a request has to be sent to the igdb api. Like every service, igdb has a rate limit and authentication that I have to comply with. In order to take care of this and not get into financial trouble, a serverless server has been my solution for fetching meta data to this day. However, this led to the fact that the first import at cold start of the server could take a good 40 seconds for a large game collection.

To tackle the problem, I now bundle the meta data from igdb with emuze. This allows me to optimize the meta data for fast and efficient access. The first import on my Steam Deck with a game collection of over 800 games now takes less than 2 seconds instead of the previous 40 seconds üöÄ

Because of the bundling i was finally able to loosen the import, so that roman numerals and numbers are interchangeable. Therefore it does not matter anymore if you name your rom `Final Fantasy V` or `Final Fantasy 5`, emuze will find meta data regardless.

Besides import optimization i decided to use `ares` as the default emulator for the 3 Game Boy Systems. This results in a more accurate emulation and pre configuring of these systems. With this 23 of the 33 supported systems are pre configured and 18 of them are bundled nowü•≥

Please let me know what you think of it in the [emuze discord](https://discord.gg/tCzK7kc6Y4).

### üí• Features
- Import time significantly reduced
  - MetaData from igdb is bundled with emuze now. Therefore the import is much faster
  - roman numerals and numbers are interchangeable, e.g. `Final Fantasy V` and `Final Fantasy 5` work both
- set ares as the default emulator for Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance
  - In contrast to mGBA, ares requires a firmware / bios file to run Game Boy Advance games
  - You can switch back to mGBA with the command line option `--mgba` if you like
- support `.gbc` file type for Game Boy Color games

### üí´ Updates / Bundles
- update bundled Ryujinx to v1.2.86
- update bundled ares to v143
- update bundled Dolphin to v2503

### ‚ùóÔ∏è Breaking Changes
- Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance won't be combined under Game Boy anymore. Therefore you need to create separate folders for these specific systems
- NeoGeo Pocket and NeoGeo Pocket Color won't be combined under NeoGeo Pocket anymore. Therefore you need to create separate folders for these specific systems

## 0.53.1

### ü™≤ Bug Fixes
- fix bundled Dolphin on Linux

## 0.53.0

This release is a big step forward towards version 1.0.
20 of the 33 supported systems are pre configured and 15 of them are bundled now.
This helps to make emuze a much more unified and console like experience.

To achieve this i had to build an [appimage](https://github.com/bmsuseluda/ares-emu-appimage) for one of my favorite emulators ares, which was released in [v142](https://ares-emu.net/news/ares-v142-released) lately.
On top of this i decided to make ares the default emulator for n64 games, because it is much more accurate then RMG.

In the last release i had to bundle an older version of Dolphin, because the sdl library i was using was outdated and resulted in gamepad mapping problems with the latest dolphin version and the Steam Deck. I had to fork this lib to achive compatibility again and now the latest version of Dolphin is bundled.

Mednafen is not just the best Sega Saturn Emulator out there, it handles PC Engine CD realy well too. Therefore i wanted to pre configure these systems for quite a while and oh boy this was a lot of work, but now it is done. Please let me know if you find some remaining bugs with it.

Hands down: DuckStation is the best PlayStation emulator. It is feature rich with upscaling and PGP correction, CHD support and so much more and is probably the most accurate PlayStation emulator on top of all this.
Last year the license was changed and with this it is not allowed anymore to bundle nor pre configure DuckStation.
But bundling and pre configuring is my main goal for v1.0 so i decided to bundle the last version of DuckStation that was released under GPL3. Therefore DuckStation will not be updated in emuze anymore and treated as Legacy for the forseeable future.

For the next release i would like to pre configure Mame and bundle some more systems.
